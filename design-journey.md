### Additional Design Justifications (Milestone 2)
[If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the design journey for Milestone 2, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet P2M2 requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in Milestone 2. Use it wisely. However, you don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey for Milestone 2.]

### Additional Design Justifications (Milestone Final Submission)

I made several changes between my initial design sketches and my final product. I changed the initial background and theme from the graphic of a fruit stand to photographs in the backgrounds because I felt that the photo backgrounds would appeal to a larger audience. The cartoon would be geared more towards younger children and their families. I wanted to include more of the Ithaca community. Since I changed the backgrounds, I changed the Navigation bar as well to match. I changed the layout of the vendors page as well to accommodate three photographs instead of two, to have more visuals. Furthermore, I restructured my Directions page to be more clear and concise.
